What's even better than Hadoop? Apache Hadoop!

Using Google's excellent Material Design Light samples, here is Shane's permanent URL http://hadoop.biz/ for (ahem) gently reminding people to use the full **"Apache Hadoop"** name instead of confusing users and only saying "Hadoop".

Note this applies to all Apache projects as well, it's just Hadoop is the most obvious example of people (often) not understanding that Hadoop software comes from the ASF, and not from vendors.
